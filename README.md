This React application is a dynamic weather application that fetches and displays real-time weather data for any city. Users can search for weather conditions by entering a city name in the search bar, and the app provides information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The application features a modern and attractive UI, enhanced with animations, gradient backgrounds, and responsive design elements. The interface is built using the Poppins font for a clean, contemporary look, and includes interactive components like hover effects and transitions to create a seamless user experience.
